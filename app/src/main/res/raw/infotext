Three students, united by a shared fascination with zodiac signs and transcendences, embarked on a creative journey to develop this app for our App Development project. Our passion for the mystical and the celestial led us to explore the intricacies of astrology, inspiring us to create a tool that makes astrology accessible and engaging for everyone. This app is designed to be a gateway for exploring your zodiac sign, understanding your personality, and uncovering the potential influences of celestial bodies on your life.

One key aspect of astrology explored in our app is the Ascendant, or rising sign. This is the zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth. It symbolizes your outer self, representing the way you project yourself to the world and how others perceive you initially. By integrating this feature, our app provides a more personalized astrological experience, offering insights into not only your sun sign but also how your Ascendant influences your life and interactions.

This app is an university project, made by Laura Hofer, Paul Kowatsch and Florian Hager at the university Klagenfurt, and is not intended to be used for professional astrological readings. It is meant to be a fun and engaging tool for exploring astrology and learning more about yourself and your zodiac sign. We hope you enjoy using it and that it inspires you to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos!
